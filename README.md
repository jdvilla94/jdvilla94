Hello my name is Josue David Villanueva, but i go by JD for short.
First generation college graduate from DePaul University. Obtained a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science 
with a concentration in Software Development. I am interested in an opportunity as a Software Engineer, iOS Developer, Game Designer, or UX Designer. 
I am looking for a fulltime job developing or designing applications. 

Thank you
